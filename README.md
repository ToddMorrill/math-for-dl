Repository of notebooks related to key topics in ML

These notebooks were derived from the open-source textbook [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preface/index.html) and were used as the basis for a Mathematics for Deep Learning seminar that I organized. The notebooks contain solutions to all the exercises in the mathematics review chapters.

If there are any issues with the solutions, please do raise an issue so that I can make edits.
